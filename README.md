snake game in C

just a small terminal snake thing i made.
was mainly practicing loops and allat, i think it'll work fine or maybe in help of a student in school.

feel free to try this out, and work on it as a project.

the controls are "wasd" to move and "x" to quit

to compile this you need to:
gcc snak.c -o snake
